# wakeonlan-mcp-server image: Linux only.
#
# Magic packets need layer-2 access to the LAN, so run the container with
# `--network host` (or on a macvlan network) on a Linux machine attached to the
# LAN it wakes. On a default bridge network the container sees only Docker's
# private subnet, and every wake fails `off_segment` before anything is sent.
# Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows runs containers in a VM, so their
# broadcasts never reach the physical LAN.

# ==============================================================================
# Build Stage
#
# This stage installs all dependencies (including dev), builds the TypeScript
# source code into JavaScript, and prepares the production assets.
#
# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM rather than the target platform: `bun run build` emits
# JavaScript, and only `dist/` crosses into the production stage, which takes
# its dependencies from the target-arch install in the deps stage below. Built
# for the target instead, the non-native leg of a
# `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` build runs under QEMU, where bun >= 1.4
# aborts with a JavaScriptCore allocator assertion and fails the multi-arch push.
#
# The constraint this assumes: the build stage produces platform-independent
# output. A stage that compiles a native addon needs the target-arch toolchain
# and cannot cross-compile this way — drop the flag there.

# Production Dependencies Stage
#
# Installs the production dependency tree for the target platform while running
# on $BUILDPLATFORM, so no JavaScript runs under QEMU. Both installs below run
# JavaScript: Bun spawns the security scanner bunfig.toml names as `bun -e`,
# and the OpenTelemetry step reads the framework's peer ranges with `bun -e`.
# Under emulation, bun >= 1.4 aborts on them as it does on `bun run build`.
#
# `--os=linux --cpu=<arch>` makes Bun select platform-gated optional
# dependencies for the target instead of the machine it runs on. This server
# installs none today (the os/cpu-gated packages in bun.lock all belong to dev
# tools); the flags keep each architecture's tree right if one arrives. Never
# copy node_modules from the build stage: its tree holds every devDependency,
# resolved for the build host.

# Install only production dependencies, ignoring any lifecycle scripts (like 'prepare')
# that are not needed in the final production image.
# `--omit=peer` drops the framework's optional peer tiers (test runner, service
# SDKs, parsers) that Bun would otherwise auto-install. Anything this server
# actually imports belongs in its own `dependencies`, so nothing needed at
# runtime is lost. The OTEL `bun add` carries the same flag, and the same
# `--os`/`--cpu` pair — without them, that install re-resolves the graph and
# pulls every optional peer back in.
#
# Then conditionally install the OpenTelemetry optional peer dependencies (Tier 3).
# Installed by default. Omit them for a leaner image at build time
# with: docker build --build-arg OTEL_ENABLED=false
# Each package is requested at the range the installed framework declares in
# `peerDependencies`, so the resolution stays inside the framework's tested
# peer range; a name with no declared range fails the build.
#
# TARGETARCH is Docker's name for the target CPU; `case` maps it to Bun's and
# fails the build on an architecture with no mapping.
